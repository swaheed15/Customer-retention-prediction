Customer Retention Prediction Web Application
This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application leveraging Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) built with TensorFlow to predict customer retention probabilities. It integrates sophisticated data preprocessing techniques including Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Standard Scaling, using tools from the scikit-learn library.

The application allows users to input custom data, performs real-time predictions, and visually presents the probability of customer retention.

ðŸŽ¯ Potential Medical Applications
This predictive modeling approach can be adapted in healthcare, particularly in Obstetrics and Gynecology, for:

Risk assessment and prediction of patient adherence to treatment plans

Early identification of patients at risk for complications (e.g., preterm labor, gestational diabetes)

Creating educational resources for medical students and interactive predictive modules for medical educators# Customer-retention-prediction
